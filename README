This bootloader is based on the AVR109 application note, using UART serial
protocol communication, to download the programm into the uC.

The communication is done using different frames to send the information.
First when the uC is resetted it sends a 3 bytes frame which are the
signature of the device; and it expect a ACK byte (0x06). If the byte is 
not received in a defined time period (aprox. 1 seg), the bootloader check
if there is a functional program in the device. If it's, then the program
starts, otherwise it halts.

When the ACK is received, the bootloader expect 2 possible frames:
1.- A frame containing data of the new program to be burnt into the device
(identified by 0x01), followed by a 2 byte (16 bit) that identifies the 
package number of the data inside the memory of the device, a number of
bytes corresponding to the SPM PAGE SIZE of the device, and a 16 bit
CRC to check data integrity.
2.- The other possible frame (id 0x12) corresponds to a 32 bits data frame
containing a 16 bits CRC and the a 16 bits one's complement, used to check 
the integrity of the CRC. This data correspons to the CRC of the complete
program to be burnt into the device.

The CRC calculation varies in function of the data length, using the best 
mask for that length. More information avalaible on: http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/crc/

To Do:
- Expand the Readme information.
- Add functionality to the PC tool in Python. (Verify data only)
- Add GUI to PC tool.
