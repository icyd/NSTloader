###   NSTloader - Not-So-Tiny-bootloader programmed in C with          ###
###           python tools, for AVR microcontrollers                   ###
##########################################################################

This bootloader is based on the AVR109 application note, using UART serial
protocol communication, to flash data to the microcontroller.

Before any attempt of communication with the microcontroller could be establish,
information of signature, device name, bootloader address, SPM_SIZE and
FLASHEND, should be added to the database (avr.db) included with the
flashing tools, all this information would be checked and used by flashing
tool, when the communication is trying to be established with the device.

-> Protocol description <-
When a RESET of the microcontroller is perform, it will send a 3 bit string,
containing the signature bytes of the device; to enter into the bootloader
program, a ACK (0x06) byte should be replied. If there is valid reply within
a period of 1 second (this time could be change in the source files of the
bootloader configuration file 'config.h' --> 'OVRFLW'), the device will lauch
the application saved in the flash address 0x0000 (if no valid application
is available, the device will keep resetting itself).

Once the bootloader is active, a number of commands could be send to performs
the flashing actions:

* Read Flash ('r'):
A frame with the page address (index) of the page in the flash memory that
want to be readen, and a 16 bit crc of the data is sent (3 bytes frame).
The device will perform the read action and reply with a data frame of
length equal to SPM_SIZE, plus 2 bytes of crc. This is a 1 page-at-a-time
read function.

* Write Flash ('w'):
A frame consisting of page address index, a SPM_SIZE length of data, and 
a 16 bit crc, will be sent to the device. The writing action will be
perform, and once is finsh will reply with an ACK. To execute all the 
writings in the flash memory the rww enable has to be perform (refer to
Exectue flash writings). This is a 1 page-at-a-time writing function.

* Flash data verify ('v'):
A frame of 1 byte (page address index, of the next page to last one, where the
data will be verified, ie. if you want to verify the data till the 0x7BFF byte (or 0x7B80
bytewise address, or 247th page in flash memory), an address index of 248 (0x7C00 bytewise)
should be sent. Followed by 2 bytes of crc. This action will perform in a complete page,
so, when the data in the hex file that you want to verify against the flash memory, is
smaller than a complete full page, the remaining bytes should be filled with 0xFF.
The device will reply with a frame of 4 bytes, consisting of the 2 bytes of crc,
result of data verying, and 2 more of the complement of this crc.

* Flash memory clear ('c'):
This command will erase all the data contained in the flash memory, and will
reply with and ACK byte afterwards.

* EEPROM read ('R'):
Similar to Flash read, but perform on EEPROM memory.

* EEPROM write ('W'):
Will update the data in the EEPROM memory (please refer to Flash write
section) with the data sent. After this command a re-enable of the
memory is not necessary.

* EEPROM data verify ('V'):
Refer to 'Flash data verify' section.

* EEPROM clear ('C'):
Will update the data on all the EEPROM memory with 0xFF bytes (erasing)
the content of this memory. Will reply with and ACK, once completed.

* Execute enable of SPM pages ('X'):
This will perform a RWW section enable, so the pages written to the flash memory
could be read and verified before leaving the bootloader. An alternative is to
perform a reset (not recommended).

* Quit bootloader ('Q'):
This will simply quit the bootloader application and reply with a ACK.

* All other bytes sent to the device will result in a NACK reply. This could be used
to detect that the bootloader is still active.

*NOTE: Please take into consideration that the commands to read/write/verify/clear
for the flash memory, are similar to the EEPROM commands, but the first ones
are lowercase.

*NOTE: when refering to the page address index, is the result of performing
a division of the bytewise page address, between the SPM_SIZE (PAGE ADDRESS / SPM_SIZE
or PAGEADDRESS>>LOG2(SPM_SIZE)).

The CRC calculation varies in function of the data length, using the best
mask for that length and a initial value of 0xFFFF.
